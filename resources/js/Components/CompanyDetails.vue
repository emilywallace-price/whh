                                We offer household services such as <b>Cleaning and Assistance with Laundry, Grocery Shopping, Meal Preparation and Transport to and from appointments</b>.
                                <br><br>
                                We also provide <b>Companionship and Welfare checks</b>.
                                <br><br>
                                We offer a <b>Sitting Service</b> to allow respite and provide reassurance for the family and friends of our customers.
                                <br><br>
                                We guarantee a specific time for each and every visit and the same helper will visit you each time.
                                <br><br>
                                We do not provide personal care and therefore our rates are significantly lower than the cost of having a carer visit.

                                Our hourly rates are from <b>Â£15 per hour</b> and you can change or stop your visits at any time.
